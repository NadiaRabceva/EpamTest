People talking from every direction 
Every hello and every goodbye feels like a cry for attention 
People, but there's no human connection 
If you want something real tonight

Baby, you know where to get it 
That overglow 
Where the morning ghosts 
Leave me all alone 
But you would never know 
It's got a hold on you
In the neon blue
